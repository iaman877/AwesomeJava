# Multithreading in Java
### Multitasking can be achieved by two ways:
* Process-based Multitasking (Multiprocessing)
* Thread-based Multitasking (Multithreading)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Multithreading in java is a process of executing multiple threads simultaneously.
Thread is basically a lightweight sub-process, a smallest unit of processing.
Multiprocessing and multithreading, both are used to achieve multitasking.
But we use multithreading then multiprocessing because threads share a common
memory area. They don't allocate separate memory area so saves memory, and
context-switching between the threads takes less time than process.
